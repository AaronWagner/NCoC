A related project is the [Ceylon Code of Conduct](https://gitter.im/ceylon/user?at=55ae8078b7cc57de1d5745fb).  It is different in that it instills actual rules.

Here is a copy in case that link becomes broken:

## Ceylon Code of Conduct

Our open source community is a group of adults committed to developing awesome software that Just Works. Every other concern is subordinate to this goal. As adults, we recognize that there are certain kinds of childish behavior that are unwelcome in our community. We respond to such behavior by generally ignoring and/or—in extreme cases—making sport of, individuals who engage in such behavior.

Such behavior includes:

* attempts to control language and/or opinions of other community members: we’re an intellectually diverse community, and we respect other people’s opinions, which often differ from our own, even on topics about which we hold strong beliefs; further, we respect that every individual has their own unique voice in which they express their views, and so we look past the form of words used, in attempting to arrive at a charitable interpretation of their views
* exaggeration of minor incidents and disagreements: any community suffers occasional disagreements; since we’re adults, we always attempt to de-escalate such disagreements at the earliest opportunity; likewise, when given the chance to just leave a disagreement in the past, and get on with the job of writing code, that’s what we do
* intentional offense-taking: in our freethinking community, it’s any individual’s right to choose to be offended by any statement or incident; likewise, it is the right of any other community member to tell an offended individual to grow up and stop acting like a baby
* use of epithets to describe other community members: it’s neither polite, nor charitable, nor just to describe the harmless and generally fair-minded members of our community using loaded and divisive epithets like “racist”, “sexist”, “homophobe”, “bigot”, etc.
* humorlessness: what’s the point of belonging to a community that doesn’t know how to laugh? In our community, humor is incentivized, and that includes occasional off-color or even offensive humor
* public shaming: participation in any orchestrated social media campaign with the purpose of ruining any person’s life and/or career is absolutely not tolerated and will result in immediate ostracization from our community
